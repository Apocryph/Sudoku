The sudoku application should be separated into the following files:

-Hanzo : Object : The static object defining the entry point to the application.
-Hanzo : Class : The class which will contain the logic for solving a sudoku puzzle
-Sudoku : Class : The class which will wrap the structure of the puzzle
--Methods will include a toString function which will print the puzzle.
--The puzzle will be stored in a one dimensional array of integers
--but will expose itself as a two dimensional array

Things that the sudoku application must do to solve a puzzle:

-Identify the other cells which can interact with a given cell.
These will from now on be referred to as neighbors.
